Error in sentence: To improve the efficiency of search and query, AE-specific operators including block-level and pixel-level crossovers, discrete perturbation mutation and direction-driven reproduction are designed within the GA-based search framework.Error in sentence: In addition, predication-based adaptation of reproduction-related parameters is implemented to speed up the search convergence, and PSO-based jumping process is further devised to avoid the stuck in local optimum.Error in sentence: For instance, well-crafted noise on the sample images of  safety-critical domain  can trigger the failure of deployed DNNs, thus leading to unpredictable finance loss, even serious damage to the environment.Error in sentence: Consequently, how to breakthrough defensive DNNs becomes an emerging and non-trivial challenge for the design of AE attacks.Error in sentence: JSMA is proposed to apply heuristic methods to search perturbation boundary of misclassification, and leverage the output gradient of the network layer to calculate the saliency map.Error in sentence: DeepFool  approaches the decision boundary by calculating the closest distance between the original input and the adversarial example, and performs an iterative attack with linear estimation to deal with the inherent non-linearity problem in high dimensions.Error in sentence: Due to limit of finance, lots of users resort to Machine-Learning-as-a-Service  to implement their DNN applications.Error in sentence: To protect the privacy of DNN models, MLaaS are generally constructed to provide users only with query interface and return them with the prediction results  regarding to inputs.Error in sentence: One popular method is to generate the surrogate network of the original DNN , and then implement effective AE attacks according to the vulnerability of surrogate model.Error in sentence: However, this approach suffers from the mismatch between the surrogate model and original model, as well as high computation cost required by surrogate model training.Error in sentence: Recent, query-based  or score-based  methods are developed to directly estimate gradient of confidence scores.Error in sentence: With the flexibility of searching framework, evolutionary algorithms can help to address the design problem related machine learning applications.Error in sentence: GA-based gradient-free optimization methods  are proposed have been proposed to synthesize adversarial examples.Error in sentence: Inspired by the merits of evolutionary algorithms, this paper proposes GA-based Query-efficient Attack  to address the perturbation optimization problem in image domain.Error in sentence: To improve the search efficiency and reduce the cost of query, we extend the GA-based search framework with AE-specific operators including block-level and pixel-level crossovers, discrete perturbation mutation and direction-driven reproduction.Error in sentence: Furthermore, PSO-based jumping process is further devised if the searching is predicted to be stuck at local optimum.Error in sentence: We identify the requirements of attacking defensive DNNs in black-box mode, and formulate the generation of AEs into a multi-objective optimization problem.Error in sentence: During the GA-based search framework, AE-specific operators including block-level crossover, pixel-level shuffle crossover, discrete perturbation mutation and direction-driven reproduction are designed to improve the efficiency of search and thus reduce the query cost to victim models.Error in sentence: The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Error in sentence: Considering the supervised-learning classification, a DNN can be represented by a function Theta: Theta, where Theta and Theta are the input set and output set respectively.Error in sentence: The perturbation is limited the human perception constraint as Theta, where Theta is the perturbation bound of Theta-norm.Error in sentence: Given a truth label Theta and Theta, the AE can be further recognized as a targeted AE if Theta, otherwise it is an un-targeted AE.Error in sentence: The perturbation is limited the human perception constraint as equation.Error in sentence: Given a truth label Theta and Theta, the AE can be further recognized as a targeted AE if Theta, otherwise it is an un-targeted AE.Error in sentence: To mitigate the serious damage of AEs, defensive mechanisms must be designed to enhance the robust of DNNs.Error in sentence: AT is designed to train the newly generated or discovered AEs with their ground-truth labels to construct defensive DNNs.Error in sentence: Theta in this work.Error in sentence: Some defense methods  against adversarial example attacks to DNNs consists of  identification and elimination  model.Error in sentence: Theta, as shown in figure.Error in sentence: When the identification  model gets a clean input, it will output "No", and sent the sample to classify DNN.Error in sentence: There are two different colored circle around example Theta, first one is red circle, it' represent untrained decentered neighborhood Theta, every example in Theta should be classified into Theta.Error in sentence: The blue ellipse represent the decision boundaries Theta for classification models, the example in Theta will be classified into Theta.Error in sentence: This two ovals divide the input space into three parts.Error in sentence: Theta but model classify it into Theta, which is called negative examples.Error in sentence: For any training image Theta, back propagation algorithm adjust the parameters of DNN to make Theta equals to Theta.Error in sentence: But for a  high-dimensional space Theta approximate to Theta, it doesn't as train dataset to train Theta.Error in sentence: Those untrained decentered neighborhood Theta space is the source of adversarial examples.Error in sentence: Defenders could build robust DNN Theta, which is called adversarial training,  as shown in figure.Error in sentence: Theta as shown in figure.Error in sentence: AS a gene-based evolutionary algorithm, Genetic Algorithm  is of immense popularity to search optimal solutions for constrained optimization problems like fault-tolerant design exploration for distributed multiprocessor systems  and neural architecture search .Error in sentence: Inspired by the process of natural selection, GA iteratively evolves a population Theta of candidate solutions to have better fitness.Error in sentence: As shown in figure.Error in sentence: MLaaS are always well constructed to provide users with query interface and return them with the corresponding prediction results.Error in sentence: Due to the selection of both query-adaptive and gradient-free policies, our method can inherently cope with adversarial training and gradient masking defense mechanisms.Error in sentence: As a cost-effective and easy-deploy defensive mechanism, input transformation is generally designed to detect or alleviate the noise on adversarial examples which has no change of original DNN models.Error in sentence: In this subsection, the efficiency of adversarial example attack is investigated, from which the motivation of this paper can be derived.Error in sentence: To be specific, the experimental in this section is based on Resnet152 model and VGG16 model, CIFAR-10 dataset.Error in sentence: We evaluate from traditional genetic algorithm and other black-box attacks from three metrics attack success ratio , average queries  and Runtime.Error in sentence: The result is shown in figure.Error in sentence: It can be learned from figure.Error in sentence: Theta compared with other methods, and the runtime also decrease almost Theta, although ASR of genetic algorithm decrease nearly Theta.Error in sentence: For example, firstly we define Theta is the probability of model Theta classifies Theta incorrectly minus classifies Theta correctly, it means the model misclassify the input when Theta.Error in sentence: In the searching region starting with Theta and ending with Theta, there are two convex regions Theta,Theta.Error in sentence: AE to the defensive mechanism of victim model.Error in sentence: Feature squeeze has been proven to be an effective method to alleviate adversarial perturbations, and the squeezed examples could be utilized to detect AE attacks by Theta-norm based detection.Error in sentence: Theta-norm based detection and the evasiveness of keeping the adversarial signals without alleviation by image compress.Error in sentence: Specifically, we use normalized Theta-norm for the first part since it represents the euclidean distance between AE sample and clean sample.Error in sentence: Given the original input Theta and its AE Thetaequation.Error in sentence: Consequently, we use Theta to denote the coverage ratio between attack method A and B, which is the ratio of the number of intersection set of them to the number of B's AEs.Error in sentence: The attack framework of GAQA is illustrated in figure.Error in sentence: During each iteration procedure, query accesses on the victim model will be conducted to obtain the confidence values of the generated AEs, which can be further exploited to generate better perturbations via well-designed selection and reproduction operators.Error in sentence: PSO-based jumping, is additionally introduced to avoid the problem of local optimum stuck.Error in sentence: The work flow of GAQA can be seen in figure.Error in sentence: Initialization stage, a set of diversified perturbations are generated as the initial population of GAQA.Error in sentence: In Stage , selection operator takes in charge of probabilistically choosing so-far best perturbations  based on the fitness values of them.Error in sentence: In Stage , Adaptive function is designed to update the parameters of reproduction operators for the next iteration procedure, which is helpful for convergence of GAQA.Error in sentence: Hence, the solution  on a clean image is explicitly denoted by a matrix chromosome Theta, where Theta and Theta are the width and height of the clean image, respectively.Error in sentence: However, due to the characteristic of diversified searching, GAQA can inherently improve attack coverage comparing with white-box attacks.Error in sentence: For AE attacks, there exists an implicit priority rule between the objectives of attack effectiveness and evasiveness.Error in sentence: Consequently, the first part of equation.Error in sentence: We use Theta to denote the population for Theta-th iteration , which is composed of Theta solutions .Error in sentence: Theta is the Thetath solution in the Theta-th generation, which is coded as a perturbation chromosome Theta.Error in sentence: Diversified initial population could avoid the searching to get stuck at local optimum, thus reducing the query number on the defensive DNNs.Error in sentence: Given a clean image Theta, the accumulated perturbation for all elements is up to Theta.Error in sentence: To make the initialization more practical, we set average perturbation distance of to adjacent solutions to Theta.Error in sentence: In specific, we first set Theta and Theta.Error in sentence: Given Theta as the increase between two consecutive perturbations, Theta can be calculated based on Theta, as shown in equation.Error in sentence: Theta has the function of clipping Theta to Theta if Theta, and clipping Theta to Theta if Theta.Error in sentence: The inferior solutions can help to improve the diversity and avoid local optimum.Error in sentence: Given the Theta-th perturbation solution in the sorted population, Theta is used to denote its probability to be selected for next generation.Error in sentence: Theta is used to control the number of selected solutions for next generation.Error in sentence: In other words, there are approximately Theta of chromosomes will be retained into the next generation.Error in sentence: Theta always equals to Theta, indicating that the chromosome with highest fitness value will be definitely selected into the next generation.Error in sentence: If Theta, the fitness value of Theta is improved compared to Theta.Error in sentence: In other words, Theta will be set for generating Theta child perturbations in next generation.Error in sentence: As mentioned in Section IV, solution  is expressed by a matrix chromosome Theta which is the same matrix dimension as the clean image.Error in sentence: Based on the traditional crossover method of GA, we introduce a block-based crossover operator according to the characteristics of matrix-expressed chromosome.Error in sentence: Then, the new child solutions are generated by the crossover operation , which is also illustrated in figure.Error in sentence: Consequently, block-based crossover will reproduce Theta child perturbations.Error in sentence: Different to block-based crossover, in this section we design a novel bit-level crossover to improve the diversity in the searching procedure.Error in sentence: Given Theta with shuffling matrix Theta and Theta with shuffling matrix Theta, one child solution can be obtained by shuffle-based crossover, expressed by equation.Error in sentence: Theta,and  Theta is Hadamard product of two matrix.Error in sentence: Mutation can also improve the population diversity and prevent the searching from local optimum.Error in sentence: Aiming at reducing the search space to achieve rapid convergence, this paper considers to let the perturbation mutation happened in discrete values.Error in sentence: Theta is used to denote the number of discrete perturbation values in the range of [-Theta, Theta].Error in sentence: Similar to the design of shuffle-based crossover, we use the 0-1 matrix Theta to represent the genes selected for mutation operations, where each element Theta is set to 1 with the probability of Theta.Error in sentence: Therefore, given the solution Theta in the Theta-th iteration, we can obtain the perturbation after mutation operation for next iteration search by equation.Error in sentence: Theta represents the Hadamard product of two matrix.Error in sentence: With the increase of searching iterations, GAQA is generally prone to get stuck at local optimum, or slowly to reach the global optimum.Error in sentence: We need to upgrade the search parameters in the searching iterations, aiming at improve the convergence and global optimum of solutions.Error in sentence: The updates of searching parameters is closely related to the number of remaining iterations, denoted as Theta.Error in sentence: Given Theta as the index of current iteration, the number of remaining iterations is predicted by equation.Error in sentence: This will lead to a reduced search space, but quickly find a local optimal.Error in sentence: For block-based crossover, Theta is number of selected father solutions, which needs to be increased to diversify  the search direction, thus obtaining better offspring solutions.Error in sentence: The constants in the above equations are hyper-parameters of GAQA, which are set according to the experiences of experiments.Error in sentence: When the evolving iterations reach to Theta, we can use jumping process to escape from the local optimal space.Error in sentence: In traditional GA, mutation operator is generally used to jump out from the local optimal position.Error in sentence: In this paper, we deploy Jumping process after the selection stage , and GAQA will conduct the jumping process when the iteration threshold Theta has been reached.Error in sentence: During the Jumping process, we design a new iterative search procedure based on PSO algorithm, which can help to escape from local optimal search due to no dropping of chromosomes.Error in sentence: The solutions of GAQA can be recognized as particles of PSO, and the perturbation changes in GAQA is related to the speeds in PSO.Error in sentence: During the iteratively search of PSO, the number of particles  is always unchanged.Error in sentence: We take the population after Selection stage in GAQA as the initial particles of PSO-Jump process.Error in sentence: We use the same fitness function in Section IV to evaluate the quality of each particles.Error in sentence: In PSO, the next moving speed Theta of each particle Theta has the correlation with previous speed Theta, the best position it ever been  and the best position in the current iteration .Error in sentence: Theta is used to generate a random number in the range of [0, 1].Error in sentence: Coefficients Theta and Theta are used to balance the speed dependences on ever-been best position and current best position of the solution swarm.Error in sentence: Theta, while  and  demonstrates the evolving of speeds Theta and fitness values Theta of perturbation solutions generation by generation.Error in sentence: The best solutions for the first three generations  can be obtained by chosen the perturbation with highest fitness value for each generation.Error in sentence: After the updatate of Theta and Theta, the fitness value of Theta can also updated by the query to defensive DNNs.Error in sentence: Theta %, calculate Theta via equation.Error in sentence: GAQA takes the inputs of clean image Theta, true label Theta, perturbation bound Theta, iteration number Theta, iteration number Theta after finding 1st effective AE, and expects to generate a best perturbation for constructing adversarial example Theta.Error in sentence: Following the initialization, GAQA evolves to find the better perturbation solutions via GA-based main search iteration .Error in sentence: During the main searching procedure, GAQA first implements queries to the victim model, and calculate the fitness values of all perturbation solutions according to the feedback confidence values on prediction classes .Error in sentence: To select the current-best solution, GAQA will sort all solutions in the current population Theta by the decrease fitness order of each solution Theta .Error in sentence: If the fitness of Theta  is greater than Theta , meaning an effective AE is generated, GAQA will inherently resort to optimize the second objectives  by reset the number of iterations .Error in sentence: After the population selection, GAQA is going to reproduce the perturbation solutions for next searching generation .Error in sentence: GAQA will conduct perturbation-varied reproduction to generate a number  of new offspring for next generation , and carries on block-based crossover  and shuffle-based crossover  to generate new solutions.Error in sentence: Afterwards, GAQA will implement discrete mutation operator on these newly produced solutions .Error in sentence: Theta with greatest fitness .Error in sentence: According to the design of PSO jumping process in Section IV, PSO-Jump first sort the input to get the initially best perturbation in current generation , then initiates the best solution for each particle Theta with position Theta .Error in sentence: For each perturbation Theta, PSO-Jump will calculate Theta  and Theta  to obtain the speed for next iteration .Error in sentence: During each iteration, it also needs to update the best-so-far perturbation for particle Theta and best perturbation in the current generation by querying the victim and calculate its fitness value.Error in sentence: The time complexity of querying on victim model is related to be the dimension of clean image Theta, which can be denoted as Theta.Error in sentence: Similar to Theorem 1, we can have the time cost of query evaluation as Theta.Error in sentence: Block-based crossover will generate Theta new perturbations, which has the cost of Theta.Error in sentence: Shuffle-based crossover is proposed to generate Theta new solutions, thus taking time cost as Theta.Error in sentence: Similarly, we can have the time cost of mutation operator as Theta.Error in sentence: The number of main iteration of GAQA is up to Theta, and PSO-Jump will be invoked during the main iteration when possibly reaching the threshold.Error in sentence: Consequently, we can obtain Theta as Theta,  which can be further reduced as: Theta.Error in sentence: GHz processor and eight NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs.Error in sentence: Transfer Learning Model   on ImageNet: using a less robust model with higher transfer training accuracy compared with standard-trained model.Error in sentence: In the experiments, Theta was set to Theta on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as , and Theta on the ImageNet as , respectively.Error in sentence: Coverage Ratio : the coverage ratio between attack method A and B.Error in sentence: In this picture, including two PSO-jump process.Error in sentence: The red line is the greatest fitness value of current chromosome set, the blue line is the estimated needs steps according to current tendency.Error in sentence: In the defensive models, removing the perturbation-varied-reproduction or shuffle-based-crossover can reduce ASR by more than a half, which indicates that the two operators have a powerful searching capacity.Error in sentence: PSO-Jump process prevents GAQA from falling into trapping into the local optimum.Error in sentence: PSO-Jump process of GAQA.Error in sentence: Theta grows slowly, and then GAQA will start PSO-Jump process to jump out of the current position.Error in sentence: In this section, we use three dataset to valuate the effectiveness of our method on defensive models compared with other five attack methods.Error in sentence: Owing to defensive model has more robustness under attacking, different attack method may has different attacked picture sequence, so we calculate the matrix of CR to evaluate coverage of methods and find the Theta additionally.Error in sentence: Because there are six attack methods, so the size of permutations of coverage matrix is Theta, which can not be shown in this paper completely.Error in sentence: We only show the matrix of one method to one method, and directly shown the minimum attack set.Error in sentence: Beside the three metrics we have mentioned before, we evaluate the additional two metrics for defensed model.Error in sentence: The first is normalized Theta euclidean distance  and MCSD in equation.Error in sentence: Experiment on different defense methods in CIFAR-10 dateset,  shows our method has greater attack success ratio in three different defense  method compared with black-box and white-box attack method in general, it proves that our approach has power searching performance.Error in sentence: Meanwhile  and  indicates that, our method  has lower queries number compared with black-box attack method in the aspect of queries number, because white-box attack method  could use gradient information, our method has greater queries number than it.Error in sentence: However, the gradient information limits the searching scope, which makes the white-box methods trap into local optimum.Error in sentence: The average MCSD of GAQA is Theta, Theta, Theta, Theta and Theta
	of those of APGD-CE, ZOO, Square, DeepFool, and GenAttack, respectively.Error in sentence: Because our the second optimization objective, GAQA could generate higher .Error in sentence: In the aspect of NED, GAQA has average Theta	,Theta and Theta reduction compared with other attack approach in three defensive models, it means, our adversarial examples are more similar to the original image.Error in sentence: The experimental results of CR on the three defensive models are shown in figure.Error in sentence: Gen GAQA has the smallest CR while other five attack methods have the similar CR.Error in sentence: According to figure.Error in sentence: GAQA has non-overlapping region with other five methods, which indicates that GAQA is irreplaceable.Error in sentence: CR than our GAQA, which means that our method is irreplaceable.Error in sentence: According to figure.Error in sentence: Compared with other five attack methods, our method achieves Theta and Theta  decrease in AQ and MQ, respectively.Error in sentence: The CR results are shown in figure.Error in sentence: Our GAQA has high ASR and few queries compared with other five attack methods.Error in sentence: We compare ASR, MQ and AQ with other five attack methods, since NED, MCSD, CR and MAS are designed for the defensive models.Error in sentence: We can illustrate that our method is suitable for different neural network architectures through these three neural networks.Error in sentence: APGD-CE, ZOO and our method can reach almost Theta ASR.Error in sentence: Genattack and our method have lower MQ compared with ZOO and Square, which indicates that genetic algorithms with well-designed operators have better performance on different Theta norm.Error in sentence: The ASR of the three black-box attack methods on ImageNet are lower than those on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 whereas our method has a better ASR on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.Error in sentence: Consequently, the generation of adversarial examples for defensive models is formulated to a multi-objective optimization problem, and GA-based searching framework is proposed to find the best perturbation for adversarial example generation.Error in sentence: Moreover, the adaptation of search-related parameters can help to speed up the search convergence, while PSO-based jumping component is implemented to escape the situation of local optimum search.Error in sentence: We also plan to extend our work to implement adversarial attacks on other applications like audio and 3D-image reorganizations.
